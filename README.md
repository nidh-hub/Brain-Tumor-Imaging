# Brain Cancer Cell Detection: A Systematic Literature Review

## Overview
This repository contains the research work conducted as part of a systematic literature review on brain cancer cell detection using image processing techniques. The study explores various imaging methods, their accuracy, and their potential to aid in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Research Objectives
- Analyze how different image processing techniques detect cancer cells in the brain.
- Compare imaging methods such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) imaging, and Hyperspectral (HS) imaging.
- Identify the most effective techniques based on accuracy and application.

## Key Findings
1. MRI techniques are widely used and highly accurate for brain cancer detection.
2. SHG and HS imaging show promise but require further research for clinical adoption.
3. Advanced algorithms like BAT with Fuzzy C-Ordered Means (BAFCOM) and deep learning models enhance detection accuracy.

## Methodology
- **Search Protocol**: Systematic review following Kitchenham and Charters guidelines.
- **Data Sources**: IEEE Xplore digital library.
- **Selection Criteria**: Inclusion of journal papers published between 2011-2021 with empirical results relevant to brain cancer detection.
- **Analysis**: Papers were analyzed to extract themes such as MR imaging, SHG imaging, HS imaging, and general imaging techniques.

## Dataset
The repository does not include datasets but references publicly available studies and methods used in the reviewed literature.

## Technologies Used
- Image Processing Techniques: MRI, SHG, HS imaging.
- Algorithms: BAT segmentation, Enhanced Capsule Network (ECN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
